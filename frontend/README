For the design, there was a focus on accessibility, and design elements were specifically chosen with this in mind.
The color palette is high contrast for those with vision impairment.
It is suitable for the colorblind as well as those with limited vision.
The function to "tap anywhere" to start the recording is useful for both those with limited vision and motor control impairment.
There are no animations on the app because some conditions cause motion sickness from these animations.
The iPhone has an option to limit motion within apps, so we want folks who have this feature enabled to experience the app
with its intended design.
Another important consideration is distinguishing buttons. Our sign in button has a bold outline and bold font, plus high contrast.
An important factor is the design of the dictation page. We chose a cream background and black text, which is an ideal
color palette for dyslexic students.
This makes it comfortable for the eyes when reading a long transcription.
We also used the font Andika, which is one of the most readable Google fonts for dyslexics due to the distiguished 
typography of the "b" and "d" letters, as well as the "a" and "e".
Our icons are easy to interpret, familiar, and high contrast.
