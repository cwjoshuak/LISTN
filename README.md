# LISTN

LISTN is an app targeted toward assisting students with note-taking
LISTN uses Google's speech recognition technology to help disabled students to get more out of their lectures.

Many students have difficulty hearing, difficulty paying attention, and difficulty remembering the content of lectures.
LISTN is a solution that allows any student to record a live lecture, and automatically transcribe the audio into readable text. The recorded text is then available for the student to read at any time, as well as being searchable.


This app will make a huge difference for students who have difficulty hearing, as they now have access to a resource that allows them to be able to read what was previously said.

The app is also friendly for students with dyslexia. The colors and fonts have been chosen specially to increase readability. 

In addition, the colors have been selected to be high contrast, so that any user with colorblindness will not run into any difficulty.

The App also intentionally excludes any recording animations. These could be distracting to anyone, and the user's focus should be on the lecture.

All of these accesibility features help out students with disabilities, while not hindering other users in any way.
Because of that, LISTN can be used by any student as an aid to notetaking and studying.



The Front-End folder contains the Swift code used to code the user-facing part of the App.

The Listn Design Folder contains all the image files used in the App

The Back-End folder contains the Python code that handles the transcription of audio.
