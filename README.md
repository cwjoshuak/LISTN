# LISTN

LISTN is an app targeted toward assisting students with note-taking
LISTN uses speech recognition technology to help disabled students to get more out of their lectures.

Many students have difficulty hearing, difficulty paying attention, and difficulty remembering the content of lectures.
LISTN is a solution that allows any student to record a live lecture, and automatically transcribe the audio into readable text.



The Front-End folder contains the Swift code used to code the user-facing part of the App.

The Design Folder contains all the image files used in the App

The Back-End folder contains the Python code that handles the transcription of audio.
